This repository houses all of my solutions for the yearly Advent of Code (it's only 2023 right now, but I plan to do some of the other ones soon)!

## What is Advent of Code?

"[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other." - [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), [Advent of Code About Page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)
